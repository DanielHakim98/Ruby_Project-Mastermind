# Ruby Project: Mastermind
* After 1 week of learning file serialization and object oriented programming, now a game called 'Mastermind' will be built
* This game mainly focuses on your reasoning and logic skils to guess the color/code of the sequences of color/code.
* So, by default, a set of 4 different code/color will be stored secretly and the player has to guess all code/color used at correct position.
* If the guessed code/color is correct and at correct position, an indicator will indicate that
* If the guessed code/color is correc BUT at WRONG position, anothre indicator will indicate that
* If the gueseed code/color is wrong, no indictor will be shown
* Oh, and the indicator will not tell which code/color is correct, so the player has to guess it by him/herself to reason which indicator refers to which code/color.
